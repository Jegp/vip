This assignment has been made using Python, sklearn (version 0.18.1) and opencv (version 3.1.1).

The code is split into two files: indexing.py and experiment.py

The file indexing.py calculates the codebook and extracts the BoW for each image, 
taken from a set of categories. Both the codebook and BoW-image table are stored in
a binary format in the 'data' folder for later use in 'experiment.py'.
The script performs the above for different values of k, currently set to a set of
80, 90, 100, 190, 200, 500, 1000, 1500 and 2000.
To run the script install sklearn and opencv in the above version, and create a
dictionary in the same folder as the script called 'categories'. This folder
should contain the Caltech 101 image dataset, which the script needs to perform
its image analysis. The pre-selects the categories 'accordion', 'bass', 'brontosaurus',
'pyramid', 'lobster', 'sunflower', 'hedgehog' and 'ferry'.

The second script, experiment.py, performs the two experiments described in the
report. The script simply extracts the data from the files, calculates the
BoW distance-vectors and derives statistical measures to examine how well
the vectors can be used to extract images from similar categories.
The script depends on the data genated above in the 'data' folder, and
extracts the metrics for one k-value at the time. This value can be changes
by changing the 'k_value' variable in line 7.
Running the script will print out statistics for running the test-queries on
both the training and test set.
